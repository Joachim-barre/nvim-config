# My Neovim config

My current neovim configuration made "from scratch" (using only plugins)
based on [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

all plugins are listed in plugins.vim

## how to use

**Warning** : this config has only been tested on linux and might not work with other os

* you need a terminal with nerd fonts dowload one at https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
* clone the repository in the neovim configuration dir obtained using : 
```:echo stdpath("config")```
in normal mode
